# Hacker Couch

**Pledge your couch to hackers!**

1. Fork this repository and put in your couch and/or travel info.
2. Other hackers can [search](https://github.com/search?q=hackercouch+berlin) to find your info.
3. To request a stay or invite fellow hackers, open an issue in the tracker.

Itâ€™s like CouchSurfing, except CouchSurfing sucks. So does AirBnB, hostels and hotels. Why not stay with fellow hackers when traveling?


## Crash my couch

* spare bed in Chicago, IL, USA, far north-side (1hr public transportation ride to downtown)
* we have cats (in case you're allergic)
* only people I know well or have a recommendation from someone I know
